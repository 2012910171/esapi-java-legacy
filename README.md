OWASP ESAPI (The OWASP Enterprise Security API) is a free, open source, web application security control library that makes it easier for programmers to write lower-risk applications. The ESAPI for Java library is designed to make it easier for programmers to retrofit security into existing applications. ESAPI for Java also serves as a solid foundation for new development.</td>

<b>What does Legacy mean?</b><br/>
<p>This is the legacy branch of ESAPI which means it is an actively maintained branch of the project, however feature development for this branch will not be done. Features that have already been scheduled for the 2.x branch will move forward, but the main focus will be working on the ESAPI 3.x branch.

<b>Where can I find ESAPI 3.x</b><br/>
